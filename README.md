# National Parks Biodiversity Analysis

## Overview

This project interprets biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, focusing on endangered species across various parks. It utilizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques to uncover insights about species conservation status, distribution, and park-specific observations. Key questions include examining species distribution, conservation status, and notable species observations.

## Features

### **Univariate Data Analysis**
- **Species Observation Distribution**: Histogram and boxplot visualizations to analyze observation counts.
- **Species Category Counts**: Bar charts to compare species categories.
- **Park Observations**: Pie chart to identify parks with the highest number of observations.

### **Bivariate Data Analysis**
- **Conservation Status Comparison**: Side-by-side bar charts for each conservation status category, highlighting trends and threats.
- **Castor canadensis Analysis**: Pie chart showing the distribution of the most observed species across parks.

### **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
- Handling structurally missing data by imputing "Safe" for unspecified conservation statuses.
- Removal of duplicate rows and inspection of data types for consistency.
- Filtering anomalous observations and standardizing dataset categories.

## Key Results

- **Species Observations**: Observations are evenly distributed across parks, with a bimodal distribution peaking around 75 and 250.
- **Conservation Status**:
  - Vascular plants are predominantly in the "Safe" category.
  - Birds dominate the "Species of Concern" category.
  - Fish are most affected in the "Threatened" category.
- **Castor canadensis**: Distribution analysis revealed equal park representation in its observation data.
